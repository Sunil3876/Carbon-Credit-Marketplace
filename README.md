## Project Title
**send_message**

## Project Description
The **send_message** project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Aptos blockchain. This smart contract allows for the creation, transfer, and management of carbon credits within a blockchain ecosystem. The contract includes functions to create carbon credits for an owner, as well as a function to transfer credits between users. Each carbon credit is represented as a structured object that has an owner, amount, and validity status.

The smart contract provides transparency, accountability, and ensures that carbon credits are properly managed and transferred between participants, helping promote carbon offset initiatives.

## Project Vision
The vision of **send_message** is to enable a blockchain-based marketplace for carbon credits where users can seamlessly create, transfer, and track their carbon credits. This project aims to create an open and secure system for managing carbon credits, providing a reliable and transparent solution to support the global effort in reducing carbon emissions.

The long-term goal is to integrate this smart contract into broader environmental and sustainability efforts by allowing organizations, corporations, and individuals to offset their carbon footprints in a transparent and automated way using blockchain technology.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with External Carbon Credit Markets**: The smart contract can be integrated with other carbon credit marketplaces, allowing for cross-platform transactions.
- **Automated Carbon Credit Validation**: Adding more sophisticated checks and balances to automatically validate the status of carbon credits (e.g., expiration).
- **User Interface Development**: Developing a frontend application to make it easier for users to interact with the smart contract and manage their carbon credits visually.
- **Carbon Credit Analytics**: Implementing advanced analytics for carbon credit data to help users track their carbon offset progress and compare it with global standards.

## Key Features
- **Carbon Credit Creation**: Users can create carbon credits and assign them to a specific owner with a defined amount and validity status.
- **Carbon Credit Transfer**: The contract allows users to transfer carbon credits from one user to another, ensuring that the sender has enough credits and automatically adjusting the amounts.
- **Blockchain-Based Ownership**: Carbon credits are stored and transferred securely on the Aptos blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency of ownership.
- **Support for Expiry Status**: Carbon credits can have an expiration status, enabling the system to track and manage expired credits effectively.
